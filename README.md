1. The Billing Management System has an intuitive Main Menu that offers various functionalities for effective management. When a user chooses to "Enter New Entry," they are prompted to input essential details. This includes specifying the car model or code (e.g., S, U, M, T), indicating the quantity of cars to be rented, and the system then calculates the total price based on the selected car model and quantity.

2. To enhance customer experience, the system allows users to opt for additional delivery services (Yes/No). The final price, incorporating these choices and government tax, is then presented to the user.

3. For a holistic view of the car rental service's performance, users can navigate to "View Total Sales" from the Main Menu. This section displays the cumulative total sales, providing valuable insights into the overall revenue generated by the car rental service.

4. To conclude their interaction with the system, users have the option to select "Exit," offering a seamless way to wrap up their session.

5. Moreover, the system generates detailed receipts for each customer, ensuring transparency and clarity in transactions. These receipts are saved to an output file and include crucial information such as customer number or ID, the car model rented, quantity of cars rented, total price, details of additional delivery services (Yes/No), and the new price after considering government tax.

6. The receipt also features an acknowledgment section expressing gratitude for choosing the car rental service, coupled with encouraging words for customers to consider returning. To enhance readability, a separator or decorative element is included, contributing to a visually appealing receipt format. This meticulous approach ensures that each customer's transaction is well-documented and accessible for reference.
